      <description>Hello World!
Thought it would be good to start things off with a little blog post all about me 👋🏼
If you’ve already read ‘about me’, you’ll know I’m currently a Ph.D candidate. If not, then I’m currently a Ph.D candidate.
I’m hoping this site will serve both as a deposit for my experiences and projects of interest as well as a trash bin for all my Ph.D thoughts and jargon.</description>
